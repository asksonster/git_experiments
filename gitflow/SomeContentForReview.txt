State vs. Strategy Pattern
Both design patterns are very similar, but their UML diagram is the same, with the idea behind them slightly different.

First, the strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable algorithms. Generally, they achieve the same goal, but with a different implementation, for example, sorting or rendering algorithms.

In state pattern, the behavior might change completely, based on actual state.

Next, in strategy, the client has to be aware of the possible strategies to use and change them explicitly. Whereas in state pattern, each state is linked to another and create the flow as in Finite State Machine.
